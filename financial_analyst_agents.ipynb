The first revolves around Tesla’s capital expenditures, which were close to $9 billion in 2025. The investor cites recent statements from the company’s CFO, who acknowledged that Tesla’s capex is expected to “increase substantially” in 2026. Sparks worries that these costs could balloon even higher than investors are expecting. [...] In that light, drooping EV sales in the here and now haven’t raised too many alarm bells. TSLA’s share price continues to enjoy high valuation premiums – ones that are head and shoulders above those of other automobile manufacturers – even after two straight years of falling deliveries.\\n\\nTesla’s latest Q4 deliveries update is a prime example of this phenomenon. Deliveries slid 15.6% year-over-year to 418,227 vehicles, yet the stock remains comfortably above $440 – a sign that investors are still willing to look past today’s delivery slowdown and bet that Elon Musk’s long-term autonomy vision will ultimately outweigh current fundamentals.\\n\\nHowever, top investor Daniel Sparks isn’t so confident such a lucrative future awaits the company and its investors.

(\\n\\n### Next earnings: confirmed on Qualcomm’s IR calendar\\n\\nQualcomm’s investor site lists the Q1 FY26 earnings conference call on February 4, 2026 (1:45 p.m. PT)—a key catalyst for guidance updates and data-center/AI commentary.

(\\n\\nWith QCOM closing at $175.25, that implies roughly ~10% upside to consensus targets—respectable, but not the kind of gap that typically eliminates execution risk. (\\n\\n## Fundamentals check: the last earnings and the next big date to circle\\n\\n### What Qualcomm last guided (still the near-term anchor)\\n\\nIn its fiscal Q4 2025 release, Qualcomm reported Q4 revenue of $11.27B and non-GAAP EPS of $3.00, and guided Q1 FY26 revenue of $11.8B–$12.6B with non-GAAP EPS of $3.30–$3.50.

The marketwide setup was explicitly expiration-heavy. (\\n\\n### 3) Insider-sale headlines and how traders spin them\\n\\nInsider sales can create headline noise—particularly when valuation is being debated. Watch whether financial media amplifies the Form 4/Form 144 angle over the weekend. (\\n\\n### 4) Semiconductor sentiment: AI leaders are steering the group\\n\\nFriday’s rally was driven in part by AI/tech strength.
